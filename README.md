# Graphs Cheatsheet

A personal cheatsheet about graphs with common algorithms implemented in Python.

Not using any libraries (including numpy or specialised graph libraries) on purpose!

## Representing graphs

There are several common ways to represent a graph:

1. Adjacency matrix: a 2D matrix where the value at position (i,j) is 1 if i and j are connected, 0 otherwise.
2. Adjacency list: a list of list, each node has a list of nodes it is connected to.
3. TODO: Edge list
4. TODO: Incidence list

## Traversing graphs

1. TODO: DFS
2. TODO: BFS

## Topological sorting
